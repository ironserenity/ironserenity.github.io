<h3>About Iron Serenity / Bio</h3></br>

Iron Serenity make original rock-blues music. Comparisons have been made to Pink Floyd, Lou Reed, Bob Dylan & many others but there is an originality and authenticity all of their own. Often down-tempo but consistently relaxing, their first album <a href="Music/Albums/What-Goes-Around/index.html">What Goes Around</a> is available on all major platforms or you can buy an <a href="Music/Albums/What-Goes-Around/index.html">mp3 download of the album</a> directly from their website.

Songwriter/Producer/Singer/Guitarist/Bassist Pete Ashman is originally from Manchester, U.K. where he studied & taught piano privately, also attending a 2 year Music Performance course and later studying Music Production. Currently a one-man band, he has worked with other musicians & producers before (and hopes to again), briefly having a band (bassist & drummer) while he was living in the USA although they did not perform often. 90% of what you hear on the recordings is just him. Having survived living in Spain during the lockdowns, he is now back living in the U.K.
