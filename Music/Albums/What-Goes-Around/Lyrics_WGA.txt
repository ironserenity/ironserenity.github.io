01 - Rise And Fall

Doctor doctor can you mend my mind?
I must be depressed 'coz i don't like the times
I got women on my mind, women on my mind
Women are blind

The man in the moon is laughing at me
American flag now the moon is free
Here comes the rise, there go the skies
Down by her lies

Here comes the rise, here comes the rise
Here comes the rise and fall of it all

Do you remember when you were so small?
And all your friends just used to call
Now your downing lager with your fish and chips
And love is a trick with a dirty fat lip

And you can get higher, you can get higher

And you get higher, you get higher
All your friends are on fire

Here comes the rise, here comes the rise
Here comes the rise and fall of it all

02 - Evergreen

Silent footsteps on a mountain
Horizon sunset clear as day
For you I gave everything
For you my heart and soul, just like fishing in a gold, a goldfish bowl

I thought I saw you in the night
Must have been a trick of the light
Evergreen, ever brown
What's going down in this town?

I had a life time to kill
But this brown shit in my heart is making me ill

I thought I saw you in the night
Must have been a trick of the light
Evergreen, ever brown
What's going down in this town?

When I awoke, our dream of splendour
Had disappeared, returned to sender

I thought I saw you in the night
Must have been a trick of the light
Evergreen, ever brown
What's going down in this town?

03 - It's Alright, Man

Well I'm in the middle of changing weather, changing seasons
Changing my life's reasons
But it's alright, man
It's alright man

Well I'm in the middle of a chain reaction I didn't start
I'm in the middle of a broken heart
But it's alright man
It's alright man

Just do the best you can and don't worry about a thing
You did the best you can (You did the best, you did the best, you did the best you can)
And it's alright man
It's alright man

It's alright, man
It's alright, man
It's alright, man
It's alright, man

04 - Hard To Tell

It's hard to tell what goes on inside a woman's mind
You just throw thoughts down there like wishing well
And it's hard to tell if things are ever gonna any better

Got no idea what the hell I'd do without my guitar
End up like the rest, poisoned, stressed, depressed in a shitty job
And it's hard to tell if things are ever gonna get any better

But if we don't try, things are never gonna get any better
And it's hard to tell if things are ever gonna get any better

06 - These Things That You Do

You may have powers but you're not enlightened, babe
The bad things that you do will all come back to you

You left me stranded in your pit of lonely sins
I'm bleeding black and blue all because of you
Found solace in my sound, what really gets me down
Is these things that you do will all come back to you

You drove me out my mind and set up camp in there
I cannot drink enough to get you out of there
You haunt me day and night by staying out of sight

You were my only light, you left without a trace
Just leaving me to burn, how long before you learn?
These things that you do will all come back to you

It pleases you to tease me till I'm on my knees
I could have handled it if you just went away
I could have got a job, somehow enjoyed my day

It's all a game to you but the pain's the same to me
Do you me to scream and shout? One day you will find out
These things that you do will all come back to you

--------------------------------------------
07 - Living in the Night

I woke up today half the world away
I lit up a blaze got dressed in a haze
I hung around till the mood took me
Far away and fucked with me

And it's a shame you're living in the day
Coz the day is taking me away
I'm living in the night, living in the night, living in the night
Living in the night, living in the night, living in the night and it feels alright

I drank seven beers, almost hit a deer
Got stoned in a field, went home, had a meal

You aint ever hustling me, all you got is what's on TV
All I need is my baby in bed with me and a nice cup of tea


------------------------
08 - I Went for a Walk by the Sea

Thought you were the one for me, thought you were the key
When I saw the truth of it, you know I just had to flee
You were just another cokehead groupie tryin' to fuck with me

I went for a walk, just Mary Jane and me by the sea

Junkie monkey, tree to tree, always on your knees
Wish I'd never met you, wish I'd never told you please

One thing you can do for me is stay away from me
Coz I'm a travelling poet, one man band, don't need you to hold my hand
Travelling poet, one man band, don't need you to hold my hand

I went for a walk, just Mary Jane and me by the sea
I went for a walk, just Mary Jane and me by the sea

09 - The Best Thing You Ever Had

Possession is nine tenths of your soul and you've grown old
You're living a lie that you somehow believe
Your woman left you five lonely years ago
And all you know is that the pain won't go

And the more you try to let her go, the more she won't go
And every time you hear her name it echoes in your soul
Drown it with the bottle let it float back up tomorrow with the rain
No point feeling oh so bad about the best thing you ever had now it's gone

Everyone stares at you from afar as you prop up the bar
They'll never know how it hurts inside
You'll never know how they can feel so glad to be alive

And the more you try to let her go, the more she won't go
And every time you hear her name it echoes in your soul
Drown it with the bottle let it float back up tomorrow with the rain
No point feeling oh so bad about the best thing you ever had now it's gone

No point feeling oh so bad, about the best thing you ever had now it's gone
