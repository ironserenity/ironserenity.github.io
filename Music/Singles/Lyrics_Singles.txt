Chilled Out Blues (Instr)

Twisted Nerve

You thought that I was the answer
But I'm just a cancer
Dark horses, black sheep, black balls, you weep
I stole your rhyming dictionary

Slow down, you're moving far too fast
No fear, those times have passed
Slow down, you're moving far too fast
Good times, you know they never last

Your dreaming of christmas' white
But it all goes black in the night
White widow, you know she grows old
My soul, you know it's gone cold

Slow down, you're moving far too fast
No fear, those times have passed
Slow down, you're moving far too fast
Good times, you know they never last

Things that go bump in the night
Trap door, shelter from light
Twisted nerve that you straightened out
Fire's gone, they say she put out

Slow down, you're moving far too fast
No fear, those times have passed
Slow down, you're moving far too fast
Good times, you know they never last

Just trying to be myself
Took a pill to free myself
Just trying to be myself
Just trying to be myself

Rise and Fall

Doctor, doctor, can you mend my mind?
I must be depressed 'coz i don't like the times
I got women on my mind, women on my mind, women are blind
The man in the moon is laughing at me
American flag now the moon is free
Here comes the rise, there go the skies, down by her lies

Here comes the rise, here comes the rise
Here comes the rise and fall of it all

Do you remember when you were so small?
And all your friends just used to call
Now your downing lager with your fish and chips
And love is a trick with a dirty fat lip
And you can get higher, you can get higher
And you get higher, you get higher
All your friends are on fire

Here comes the rise, here comes the rise
Here comes the rise and fall of it all

Evergeeen (Council House Cocktail Mix)

Silent footsteps on a mountain
Horizon sunset clear as day
For you I gave everything
For you my heart and soul
Just like fishing in a gold, a goldfish bowl

I thought I saw you in the night
Must have been a trick of the light
Evergreen, ever brown
What's going down in this town?

I had a life time to kill
But this brown shit in my heart is making me ill

I thought I saw you in the night
Must have been a trick of the light
Evergreen, ever brown
What's going down in this town?

When I awoke, our dream of splendour
Had disappeared, returned to sender

I thought I saw you in the night
Must have been a trick of the light
Evergreen, ever brown
What's going down in this town?

Satisfied (Acoustic)	2019

Had a woman and you know she lied
Had a woman, kept your hands tied
Had a woman and you almost died
Just trying to keep her satisfied
Satisfied

Had a woman and you know she faked it
Had a woman, you both could have made it
Oh well

Had a woman and you know she lied
Had a woman, kept your hands tied
Had a woman and you almost died
Just trying to keep her satisfied
Satisfied

Still Dont Know What it Means	2020 June 7

Inside out, outside in
As it begins
Feeling ill, bitter pill
Some way to win

Still don't know what it means
Still don't know what it means

You meet someone who turns into
Everything you ever knew
Sometimes it's all one false alarm
Just need the sun on my spine, her in  my arms and I

Still don't know what it means
Still don't know what it means
